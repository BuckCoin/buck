     * (mainnet, testnet, regtest), and have now-ancient timestamps. So we need to
     * handle the case where we might use the genesis block's timestamp as the
     * median-time-past.
     *
     * GetMedianTimePast() is implemented such that the chosen block is the
     * median of however many blocks we are able to select up to
     * nMedianTimeSpan = 11. For example, if nHeight == 6:
     *
     *    ,-<pmedian  ,-<pbegin            ,-<pend
     *   [-, -, -, -, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] -
     *
     * and thus pbegin[(pend - pbegin)/2] will select block height 3, assuming
     * that the block timestamps are all greater than the genesis block's
     * timestamp. For regtest mode, this is a valid assumption; we generate blocks
     * deterministically and in-order. For mainnet it was true in practice, and
     * we aren't going to be starting a new chain linked directly from the mainnet
     * genesis block.
     *
     * Therefore, for regtest and mainnet we only risk using the regtest genesis
     * block's timestamp for nHeight < 2 (as GetMedianTimePast() uses floor division).
     *
     * Separately, for mainnet this is also necessary because there was a long time
     * between starting to find the mainnet genesis block (which was mined with a
     * single laptop) and mining the block at height 1. For any new mainnet chain
     * using Zcash code, the soft fork rule would be enabled from the start so that
     * miners would limit their timestamps accordingly.
     *
     * For testnet, the future timestamp soft fork rule was violated for many
     * blocks prior to Blossom activation. At Blossom, the time threshold for the
     * (testnet-specific) minimum difficulty rule was changed in such a way that
     * starting from shortly after the Blossom activation, no further blocks
     * violate the soft fork rule. So for testnet we override the soft fork
     * activation height in chainparams.cpp.
